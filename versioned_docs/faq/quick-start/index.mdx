Unlock the full potential of your server by getting unrestricted access to all MEE6’s features and plugins

Why do we call this the **best feature**? Well, because it is!

Premium boosts all the plugins you've enabled so far, such as **Custom Commands** that get its limited 1 slot boosted to 500 available slots.

It also brings totally new features, such as the Custom Bot. Check out the Custom Bot guide here
