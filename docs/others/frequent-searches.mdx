### How do I invite No Name Bot to my server?

Go to [nnsvn.me](https://botapp.nnsvn.me/), click on **Add to server** and follow the instructions on your screen. Afterwards, you can start managing it there by selecting the server from the dropdown in the top right corner.

### Why isn't No Name Bot responding to anything?

1. **Make sure you're using the right prefix**
   Type `@✰๖ۣۜNσ ๖ۣۜNαмε✰#7698 prefix`. If No Name Bot responds with a different prefix from what you are currently using, you are using the wrong prefix. You can change it on the [control panel](https://bot.nnsvn.me/dashboard).

2. **Check that No Name Bot has permissions**
   Check the channel settings to see if No Name Bot has read and write permissions for the channel. **Please double check this**, this is the most common reason why No Name Bot isn't responding.

3. **Ensure No Name Bot is visibly online**
   Make sure that No Name Bot is online - [Discord might be having issues](https://status.discordapp.com/) or No Name Bot might be restarting.

4. **Check your command settings**
   If none of this works, make sure that all No Name Bot commands are enabled by visiting the [control panel](https://yagpdb.xyz/), logging in and selecting your server, clicking on **Core** and **Command Settings**. Make sure that **All commands enabled?** is checked and that there are no command overrides blocking the commands.

If you still have an issue, then you can contact us at our [support server](https://bot.nnsvn.me/discord).

### What is the prefix and how do I change it?

The prefix is what the bot responds to for commands. The default prefix is `-` (a dash). To change the prefix, do the following steps.

1\. Visit the [control panel](https://botapp.nnsvn.me/dashboard)
2\. Log in with your Discord account
3\. Select your server
****4. Change the prefix in the text box and click on **Apply**

### How do I set up role menus/role reactions/self-assignable roles?

The feature is still being worked. Please be patient.

### Bot responds with "Missing a required role" when I try to use my rolemenu

This is a mistake many people make. Go back to the control panel and make sure that no role command/group has set a **required role.** If one role is set, set it to none:

### Why is the bot not giving the role when I use the role command?

The bot can only assign roles that are below it in the role hierarchy, check that the bot's highest role is above the role you wish to assign.

### How do I unban people?

You can unban people through Discord. No Name Bot also has an `unban` command.

### How do I enable developer mode?

Go to Settings -> Advanced and click the developer mode slider.
