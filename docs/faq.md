- Try to change the server voice region, which can be changed through the server settings, for more information check out this Discord article.
- Check your Internet connection, this can be done with speedtest.net.
- If you are listening with other people, ask them if the bot is also lagging for them, if it is you might want to join our support server for further assistance. The link is in the About.

# I can't hear sounds from the bot.
- Check that you have audio coming from Discord, for instance, check if you can hear anyone else.
- Check if either you or the server has muted the bot, this can be seen by the icon next to it (microphone with a dash through it), which is either red (if server muted) or grey (if muted by you).

# Where to know all the commands?
You can go to the command page or use the help command. **`nn_help`**

# Does the bot support English?
Err..., I can't tell you immediately right now. Now, the bot mainly supports Vietnamese. Although the bot has supported multilangual and server owners have the ability to change config, many of the elements have not been translated. (cuz I'm ~~lazy~~ busy) However, I'm trying my best to add English into this bot. Please be patient. =((

# The command didn't work as it was set?
Hmmm, if you have to deal with this situation, make feedback to me by using the command. **`nn_feedback`**

# Why is the bot offline?
More than likely, we are rebooting for an update or performance fixes. If the bot is ever offline for more than 30 minutes, reach out at our support server to see if there's major downtime planned.

# Are you planning to make some paid features in the future?
Initially, I plan to make this bot 100% free to everyone and that donation is completely voluntary. If this changes in the future I will notify you about that. 

# Why does this bot require some administrative permissions?
It's just to make it easier to set up and use this bot. You will notice that many commands require the Admin permission to take action.

:::danger By the way, if you are afraid of giving the bot permission roles, feel free to not using the bot!

# I can't play mulltiplayer games in voicechat. How can I deal with this?
You need to update Discord to the least version in order to play games in voice chat. However, only Discord clients (maybe also web) support this new feature, mobile users need to wait for further information.
