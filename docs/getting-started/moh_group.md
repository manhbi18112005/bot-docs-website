You can add multiple MOH Group in addition to the default solo billing number. These are used to bill to academic groups, COVID assessment centres and AFAs.

To add a group to your profile, go to the Settings tab and into the Basic information screen. You'll see a field at the bottom called MOH Selector. Please turn that on. Below that you can enter your MOH Group (i.e. M224). If you only plan on submitting a few claims then keep the Default MOH Group as "None" otherwise select the most frequently used group and then press back to save your settings.

When you want to submit a claim using your new MOH Group, you should see a MOH Group field in the Claims screen under Manual Review which you can use to select the new MOH Group.
