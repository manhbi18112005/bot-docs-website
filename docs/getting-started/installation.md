## Create an Account

When you sign up you'll be asked to create a new login and password. Please use an email address that you can access from your phone.

The sign up will ask you for your CPSO Number and your specialty. The claims won't be sent to the ministry until you have received your billing number and designated IntelAGENT as one of your agents.

You will receive an introductory email with instructions to designate IntelAGENT as your billing agent. You can review the [instruction guide](designation.md).

:::tip

You don't need your billing number to start entering claims. The claims will stay in pending status until you designate IntelAGENT as your billing agent.
